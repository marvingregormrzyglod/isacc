            <p>For more than four decades, ISACC has trained thousands of development practitioners as well as pastors and church leaders on what it means to do wholistic or Integral Mission. Under this rubric are non-formal courses on ISACC’s thematic interests: gospel and culture issues, social development, communication across cultures and witness to society in general. As a training and capacity-building organization, ISACC has trained more than 200 churches and faith-based development organizations in community development under its Hasik-Unlad program, which has for its theme, ‘The church as an agent of change.’</p>
            <p>ISACC’s Transformational Development course has trained thousands of practitioners and emerging leaders into understanding Integral Mission and development. This program has spawned and inspired the setting up of many faith-based organizations that now serve the poor. ISACC has likewise sent training teams to Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos under the auspices of Open Doors, an organization that serves church communities in restricted contexts. Currently, the organization is pioneering ASTRAD or the Asian School of Transformational Development to train development practitioners who wish to have formal training under its Masteral degree programs, namely an MA in Transformational Development, MA in Cross-Cultural Studies and MA in Social Entrepreneurship.</p>
