                    <p>ISACC’s advocacy work has deep historical roots, culminating in the mobilization of church communities during the resistance to the Marcos regime.

                    <h2>Faith and Politics Initiative</h2>
                    <p>During the 2022 Presidential Election, we launched a major webinar series on “Faith and Politics.” In partnership with Evangelical scholars and experts, we aimed to help Christians engage in national transformation based on sound biblical-theological teachings.</p>
                    <p>This initiative is a collaboration with the <strong>PCEC Justice, Peace and Reconciliation Commission (JPARCOM)</strong> and <strong>Langham Publishing (UK)</strong>. The series will result in a book that addresses the need for contextualized resources in a region where most seminaries rely on Western textbooks, hoping to be a valuable contribution to the conversation on theology and politics in the Philippines and Asia.</p>
