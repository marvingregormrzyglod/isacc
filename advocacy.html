            <h2>ADVOCACY AND POPULAR EDUCATION FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE (PEGG)</h2>
            <p>ISACC's advocacy has been instrumental in mobilizing communities and shaping national conversations on justice and governance. From providing a center of evangelical presence during the 1986 People Power uprising to engaging in current issues, we are committed to being a voice for social responsibility.</p>
            <p>Our work intentionally trains young people to become biblically literate and able to apply God’s Word to issues in the public square. A unique feature of ISACC’s educative and advocacy programs is the integration of Biblical perspectives into the analysis of complex issues.</p>

            <h2>Faith and Politics Initiative</h2>
            <p>A major initiative during the 2022 Presidential Election was a series of webinars on “Faith and Politics.” In partnership with Evangelical scholars, we aimed to help Christians become more socio-politically engaged in transforming our nation based on sound biblical-theological teachings. This collaboration with PCEC JPARCOM and Langham Publishing will result in a book designed to be a valuable contribution to the conversation on theology and politics in the Philippines and Asia.</p>
