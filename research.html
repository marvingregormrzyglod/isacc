                <h3>Notable Publications from Research</h3>
                <p>During the mid-90s ISACC embarked on a groundbreaking research into the coming of American Protestant Missions the first three decades of the last century, focusing on the intercultural communication miscues in the interface with Filipino religious consciousness. Part of the results has been published in the book, <em>A Clash of Cultures</em>, published by De La Salle University and Anvil Press. This was funded by the PEW Foundation in the US.</p>
                <p>An ICCO-funded participatory research into the economic empowerment of seven grassroots communities by seven NGOs yielded learnings written up in the book, <em>Rise Up and Walk, Religion and Culture in Empowering the Poor</em>, published by Regnum and the Oxford Center for Mission Studies in the UK.</p>

                <p>As part of its educative mission, ISACC does Collegial Sharing after a major research or grassroots development project and shares learnings through publications, seminars and video productions.

                    <h4>Conversion to Protestant Christianity Under Early American Rule, Some Intercultural Communication Problems (1995-1999)</h4>
                    <p>A massive four-year study of the interface between Filipino religious consciousness and conversion themes brought by American Protestant missionaries at the turn of the century. The research looks into the cross-cultural problems surfaced by the ambiguity of American Protestant missions coming as both an imperial power and a civilizing and Christianizing instrument. It examines the intercultural communication process to see if there is culture-fit between the messages brought and the indigenous religious imagination based on oral histories of initial converts, archival sources here and in the US, textual analysis of contemporaneous folk literature and case studies of indigenous religious movements existing at present. Funded by the PEW Foundation in the US, the study is the first of its kind outside US territory and done completely by local scholars.</p>
