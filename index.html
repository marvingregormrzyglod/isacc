        <h2>In the Philippines, the heart to do good is everywhere.</h2>
        <p>
            From neighborhood pantries to mission-driven startups, <br>
            kindness runs deep in our culture. <br><br>
            But good intentions alone aren’t enough. What we often lack is structure. Clear ways to turn compassion into lasting impact.<br><br>
            That's why ISACC is building tools and ideas for communities and businesses to make generosity not just a moment, but a movement.
